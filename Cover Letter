I started programming with "Baltie3" when i was 8 years old. Moved to "Scratch" but came back to "Baltie3", in Middle school I found out i am good at finding solutions
first in pseudo code, then moved to c++ but haven't sticked a long time with it. At the age of 17 i started learning programming more seriously, i choosed web 
development beacuse i was familiar with it thanks to school. Unfortunatly school, and work haven't allowed me to spend as much time as i wanted with programming, but 
that didn't stopped me to make progress. In my previous work places, i learned independance, contact with potential clients, and teamwork. My current job requires me to
work overtime, up to 11h a day. Thanks to that i am no stranger to hard work, and frankly i enjoy it.
